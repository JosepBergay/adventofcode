# My Advent of Code adventure.

The aim of this repo is to share my aoc exercises, maybe we can comment them up, learn in the process and most importantly have some fun!

## Features

- Autofetch inputs 🎉
- Output answers via console 🖨

## Instructions

If you intend to use it you should set an env var in the shape of `SESSION_COOKIE=123-replace-with-yours` containing the session id so it can properly fetch all inputs. You can grab yours from https://adventofcode.com/ once logged in (devtools ftw!).
